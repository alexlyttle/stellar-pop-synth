# Stellar Population Synthesis Tool

This tool is built to read a grid of stellar evolutionary tracks generated by Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics (MESA) and create a synthetic population of stars. Unlike most uses of population synthesis (e.g. simulating clusters) this tool creates a population of stars in an equivalent evolutionary phase. The first objective is to simulate a population of stars during their core helium-burning phase of evolution (the so-called 'red clump').
